# Tails on Trails Frontend

This is the frontend repository for the Tails on Trails app. It contains the code necessary for the client to view the app. It was designed to work with the app's [backend repository](https://github.com/Siegfer/tails-on-trails-backend). To use the entire app, visit the [Tails on Trails](https://tails-on-trails-front.herokuapp.com/) site.

## About

Tails on Trails is an app for shelters to help them keep track of all their current dogs & volunteers. It was made through the collaborative efforts of Robert Estrella and Nicholas Tran.

## Installation

### Create Local Repo

1. Fork and clone this repository and the corresponding [backend repository](https://github.com/Siegfer/tails-on-trails-backend) to your local computer.
2. Run `npm i` to install all necessary dependencies
3. Set up a `.env` file to hold the `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` variable (set to `http://localhost:8000`).

### Set Up Local Database

1. Ensure you have MongoDB installed on your local computer by typing `mongosh` into your terminal to launch the Mongo shell (install MongoDB if necessary)
2. Upon running the backend repo (see next step), a new database named `tailsontrails` should automatically appear in your local MongoDB (confirm by typing `show dbs` while in the Mongo shell)

### Run Locally

1. Run `npm start` from within both the backend directory and the frontend directory
2. View the live version of the site at `http://localhost:3000` in the browser of your choosing

## Code Snippet

**Determine if what type of user is logging in**
```javascript
const handleSubmit = (e) => {
    e.preventDefault();
    const userData = { email, password, checked };
    const role = checked ? "shelters" : "walkers";
    const loginEndpoint = `${REACT_APP_SERVER_URL}/${role}/login`;
    axios
      .post(loginEndpoint, userData)
      .then((response) => {
        const { token } = response.data;
        localStorage.setItem("jwtToken", token);
        setAuthToken(token);
        const decoded = jwt_decode(token);
        props.nowCurrentUser(decoded);
      })
      .catch((error) => {
        console.log("===> Error on login", error);
        alert("Either email or password is incorrect. Please try again");
      });
  };
}
```
## Stretch Goals

- Add more type of volunteers
- Add ability to set allow volunteers to set when they are available
- Further customize the shelter & volunteers profile to display more relevant information
- Add additional features like ability to show all a chart of all dogs that have been adopted.
- While our app is designed for desktop use and not mobile use, we could make its design more responsive (it already is responsive, but it is not as mobile friendly as the user might want); alternatively, we could create a separate mobile version of the app
