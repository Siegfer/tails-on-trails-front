        Your roll as a Volunteer is important to both dogs and shelters.
        Shelters don't have enough people to volunteer, which means more dogs
        aren't getting their daily needs fullfilled. You're here to fix that
        problem! Yay for doggies!

      <p id="dev-story">
        Tails on Trails is a General Assembly project idea that Nicholas Tran
        and Robert Estrella designed for their 3rd project in the SEI802
        Software Engineering Immersive Program. Their love for dogs inspired
        them to create a website that helps lonely dogs in the shelter get out
        and explore the world with potential of being adopted.
